## 📦 Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The preferred installation method is with [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). This is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. In Xcode, do the following:

- Select **File ▸ Add Packages...**
- Search for `https://github.com/pnicholls/userkit-ios` in the search bar.
- Set the **Dependency Rule** to **Up to Next Major Version** with the lower bound set to **0.1.0**.
- Make sure your project name is selected in **Add to Project**.
- Then, **Add Package**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```swift
import UserKit

// Initialize with your API key
UserKit.configure(apiKey: "your_api_key")

// Identify your app user
UserKit.shared.identify(id: "1", name: "Example User", email: "example@user.com")
```

That's all that is required! 

Now you can jump over to [getuserkit.com](https://getuserkit.com), find your logged in user and give them a call.
